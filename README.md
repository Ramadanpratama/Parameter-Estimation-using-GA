# Parameter-Estimation-using-GA
This project investigates the kinetics of thermal degradation in aluminium composite panel using non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
The files contains data from various heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 K/min under a nitrogen atmosphere, ranging from 300 to 1000 K.
Kinetic modeling was performed using three isoconversional methods (Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose)
Genetic algorithm (GA) optimization implemented through Gpyro software.
