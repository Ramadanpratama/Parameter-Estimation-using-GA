# Thermal Degradation Kinetics of Aluminium Composite Panels (ACP)

This repository contains data and analysis related to a study on the thermal degradation behavior of Aluminium Composite Panels (ACP) used in building facades. The research aims to address the insufficient characterization of ACP thermal properties, which may pose potential safety risks in building applications.

## Study Overview

We investigated the kinetics of thermal degradation in ACP using non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under the following conditions:
- Temperature range: 300-1000 K
- Heating rates: 5, 10, 15, and 20 K/min
- Atmosphere: Nitrogen

## Repository Contents

1. **TGA Data**: Excel files containing raw thermogravimetric analysis data for various heating rates.
2. **Isoconversional Analysis**: Excel files with calculated values from isoconversional methods (Friedman, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose).

## Software

The genetic algorithm optimization was implemented using [Gpyro software](https://github.com/lautenberger/gpyro).
